                <h3>Course Description</h3>
                <p>The Hidden Rivers Course is an interdisciplinary seminar on the city of Toronto. Our goal is to deeply understand our city's past, make sense of its present, and grapple with its future together. The course will involve a core set of readings, lively discussions, hands-on activities, walking tours, and city excursions. There are no "lectures"—our goal is to learn from each other. All perspectives are welcome: we will be in conversation with activists, technologists, historians, planners, writers, scientists, artists and more. We are united by the shared goal of collective-sense making and rootedness in our city.</p>

                <p>This seminar is completely open to anyone in Toronto, regardless of educational background, discipline, or experience.

                <h3>Seminar Structure</h3>
                <p><strong>Dates and times:</strong> The Hidden Rivers Course lasts five weeks, with two meetings per week:</p>
                <ul class="expectations-list">
                    <li>Thursdays from 6pm – 8pm</li>
                    <li>Sundays 10am – 1pm</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Thursday reading discussions will take place in a classroom on the University of Toronto campus. Exact location TBD.</p>
                <p><strong>Session structure:</strong> The introductory sessions will be led by Matthew Jordan; the rest will be led by guests, all of whom are local experts in their respective fields. The Thursday session will typically involve a reading and discussion on a Toronto-related topic; the Sunday session will typically involve exploring the city with the relevant expert in that topic. The goal of these sessions is to feel as close to the source material as possible; we will read and walk Toronto's history in equal measure.</p>
